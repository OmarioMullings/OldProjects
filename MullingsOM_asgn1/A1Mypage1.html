      <blockquote><font face = "palatino" color = "green">I was born in <strong> Mandeville Jamaica</strong>. When i was around nine my mother and i both <br /> 
      imigrated to Canada and ever since i have been a proud <cite>Torontonian.</cite> I have now spent<br /> more than half my life in Canada
      i go back to jamaica as often as i can. However my focus is<br />on the future and starting my career in the <b>ICT</b> field whether that be as a front end dev,<br />back end or even an IT consultant which i have done before. All in all i am a pretty normal person<br /> i have other interests and hobbies outside of <b>ICT</b> such as Weight lifting good music and even Rugby as you can see by the picture on the right. --->

      <li>firstly i want to graduate at the end of this semesters.</li>
      <li>find a job in my field</li>
    </ul>
    For my first goal i will achieve it by the end of the year, as for the 2nd, that i will leave open but i am <br /> focusing on finding a job within the next 6 months.<br />
    <u>some of my smaller goals include:</u>
    <ul>
      <li><strike> Go to Jamaica atleast once in 2019 </strike></li>
