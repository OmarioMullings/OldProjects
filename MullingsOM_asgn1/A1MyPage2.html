      <blockquote><font face = "palatino" color = "green">
        I have many interests most of which would not usually be a hobby for the stereotypical <sup>developer</sup>> but are still part of me and make me who i am. I Enjoy <sub>great</sub> movies, my favorite director would have to be quintan terantino, his use of camera angles and keen eye for great actors helps create amazing films. Most of my free time is spent exercising. For cardio i like to work in the basketball court, this helps with stress and is great for cardiovascular health. <br /> On the other spectrum of fitness i do alot of weights aswell. This is usually a mix of power and strength workouts. Traveling is another passion of mine, i have been to many states in America and obviously i have been to Jamaica. I am hoping to travel to eaxh contenent at least once in my life. One thing that is very constant in my life is my love of <!-- put an href here--> music, it drives me through hard times and helps increase the joy i feel during the good times

      <font face = "impact" size = "4" color = "purple"> Anime:</font><br />
      I have had a love for anime for as long as i can remember, it has always been a part of my life, i can sit down and watch seasons upon seasons.<br />
      The best animes in my opinions are the ones that you can connect to and never forget, you find yourself watching them maybe twice or even Thrice!
      This has translated over time to my love of movies and appreciating how they are created and the acting that goes into producing good quality films.
      above i have linked one of my favorite anime sites.<br />
      <font face = "impact" size = "4" color = "purple"> Rugby:</font><br />
      Rugby has made me who I am today, it has helped with my confidence and leawderships skills. <br /> 
      Not only has it helped me be a better person internally but it has also helped me have an easier time interacting with others <i>Team work makes the dream work </i> above i have linked the Rugby world cup site for 2019. <br />
      <font face = "impact" size = "4" color = "purple"> Music:</font><br />
      Music is integral to my life, it is an expression of my mood, emotions and it also is a great tool i use when coding. <br />
      I believe that without the right playlist i cannot code to the best of my abilities.<br />
      Unlike most other people i have a very wide taste in music , i can listen to all types of genres whether it be rock or rap. 
      Above i have added a link to Spotify, my got to player for all my music needs.
